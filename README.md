Step 1: Create the HTML markup for the base quiz engine and style it accordingly.

Step 2: When a user has selected an option and clicks the next button, just silently move to the next question. If no option is selected, throw an error.

Step 3: When the user is on the final question and clicks on the next button, raise hell and evaluate results like so.

Step 4: Find out which option the user has selected and match it to the list of predefined answers. Return a simple array so we can evaluate the results later and present some data in the final screen.
